# SERVER_NAME: The server name is important, as it will help users differentiate
# between multiple accounts.

PLUGIN_DIRS="./node_modules/@speckle,./plugins"

# PORT: The port you want the speckle server to run on. Make sure the port is accesible
# if you have any firewalls set up (ie, ufw).

REQ_SIZE=10mb
